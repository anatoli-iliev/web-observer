/**
 * The Vercel bridge: everything Web Observer knows about `openclaw-vercel-insights`.
 *
 * Nothing about Vercel is reimplemented here. This module locates that skill,
 * decides whether the copy installed is new enough to answer questions about
 * error logs, runs it, and converts what it returns into a shape that is safe to
 * deliver into a chat.
 *
 * ## The pin
 *
 * Request-log support lives on the `logs-surface` branch, which is version 1.1.0
 * and is expected to merge to `main`. Everything about that pin is in this file
 * and in README.md, and switching to a merged `main` or a tagged release is a
 * change to {@link REQUIRED_LOGS_REF} and the documented install command.
 *
 * TODO(logs-surface): re-pin once
 * https://github.com/anatoli-iliev/openclaw-vercel-insights/tree/logs-surface
 * merges to main. Then {@link REQUIRED_LOGS_REF} becomes the tag or "main", and
 * {@link LOGS_INSTALL_HINT} loses its `#ref`. {@link hasLogsSurface} keeps
 * working either way, because it tests for the feature rather than the version.
 *
 * ## Two rules from the underlying API
 *
 * **Never send `--until`.** Measured against a live account on 2026-08-18: a
 * window whose end is more than about an hour in the past is answered with
 * `HTTP 400 {"name":"ExceedsBillingLimitError"}`, which the skill reports as a
 * failure. With `--until` left at its default of now, every `--since` succeeds,
 * from 30 minutes to 7 days. Varying only `--since` removes that failure mode
 * rather than handling it, so {@link errorsArgv} has no way to express an end.
 *
 * **Empty is not healthy.** An empty result is exit 0, and runtime logs are
 * retained for one hour on Hobby. So "no errors" from a window longer than the
 * retention can mean the logs aged out. That is reported, never smoothed over.
 *
 * ## The redaction boundary
 *
 * The underlying skill scrubs only its own Vercel token out of log content.
 * Whatever the application printed, which can include secrets, tokens and
 * customer data, arrives verbatim. So {@link toSafeEntries} is a boundary, not a
 * formatter: with `includeMessages` off, the message, the log lines and the raw
 * row are **not copied out of this module at all**. Code downstream cannot leak
 * what it was never handed, which makes the guarantee structural.
