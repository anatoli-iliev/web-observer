 * Output: where it goes, and how a table is laid out.

 * here than in most tools: on a scheduled run, stdout **is** the message sent to
 * the user, so a stray line is a notification.
 *
 * The division is strict. Anything a person is meant to read goes to stdout only
 * when it is the answer. Diagnostics, warnings and progress go to stderr, where
 * cron records them in the run log without delivering them.
