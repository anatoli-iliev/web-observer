/**
 * The scheduled Vercel poll: error logs, and the performance budget.
 *
 * Two watches share one command because two cron jobs call it, each on its own
 * interval, and each run does whichever parts are due. That keeps the alert-once
 * and recover-once rules in one place, and it means an error poll and a budget
 * check never disagree about what has already been reported.
 *
 * The three decisions worth knowing about:
 *
 * **The window widens to cover a gap.** Each poll asks for `windowMinutes`, or
 * for however long it has been since the last successful poll plus the
 * configured overlap, whichever is longer. If the Gateway was off for two hours,
 * the next poll looks back over those two hours instead of the usual twenty
 * minutes. This is safe only because the end of the window is never specified:
 * a window ending in the past is refused by the API with HTTP 400, while any
 * `--since` with the end left at now succeeds. Both facts were measured.
 *
 * **Deduplication is by request id.** Overlapping windows re-report the same
 * errors by construction, so an id already alerted about is not alerted about
 * again. That is what makes the overlap free.
 *
 * **An empty answer is not proof of health.** Runtime logs are retained for one
 * hour on Hobby, so a window longer than that can come back empty because the
 * logs aged out. The underlying skill says so in its notes, and those notes are
 * passed on rather than dropped.
