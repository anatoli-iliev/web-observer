/**
 * Configuration: the shape on disk, how it is validated, and the URL allowlist

 *
 * Two rules shape this module.
 *
 * **Nothing is silently ignored.** An unknown key is a configuration error
 * naming it, not a key that is dropped. A watch written with `intervalMinute`
 * instead of `intervalMinutes` would otherwise keep the default cadence
 * forever, and the user would have no way to tell from the output that the
 * number they wrote was never read. The same reasoning applies to every
 * misspelling: this file is edited by hand.
 *
 * **The allowlist has exactly one source.** {@link allowlistOf} derives it from
 * the configured watch URLs and nothing else. There is no flag that extends it
 * and no other constructor for it, so "Web Observer only contacts hosts the
 * user configured" is a property of the code rather than a claim in a document.
