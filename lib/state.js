/**
 * Durable state, and the atomic write that keeps it trustworthy.

 * again, which is the behaviour that teaches people to mute a monitor.
 *
 * It is therefore written atomically, to a temporary file in the same directory
 * followed by a rename. A partially written file would fail to parse on the next
 * run, be treated as absent, and re-alert everything that was already down: the
 * exact failure state is designed to prevent.
