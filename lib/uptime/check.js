/**

 * user's configured watch URLs and nothing else, so a redirect cannot take a
 * request, or a configured header, to a host the user never named.
 *
 * Nothing a server sends is copied into a failure detail. A body is measured,
 * never quoted, and a header is never echoed: a check runs against a site that
 * may be compromised or simply misconfigured, its output is delivered straight
 * into a chat, and a detail line has no business carrying whatever a stranger
 * put in a response.
